3. To create a new SASS component, create a new file and name it _[YOUR FILE NAME].scss
	- The underscore indicates it is a partial
4. Save your SASS partial
4. Open the app.scss SASS file
5. Import your partial following the same schema `@import '[YOUR FILE NAME]';`
6. If you ran the dev command, webpack should be watching and auto-compile your SASS to `./client/build/css/screen.css`
